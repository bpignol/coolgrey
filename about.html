      The logo of ‘Cool Code in Grey Berlin’ is  inspired by the Bauhaus aesthetic, in tribute to the values promoted by this current, advocating experiments, mixing disciplines, and simplifying forms. The Bauhaus school was founded nearly 100 years before this project and, for a short while, located in Berlin. <a href="https://www.bauhaus100.de/de/index.html">Discover more on Bauhaus 100.</a>

      The background video follows individuals from the tech community on their quiet strolls through Berlin and is better experienced with the soundtrack, inviting the visitor to try not being shy. The music is produced by Capt.Lovelace, who studied in Berlin in 2013 and is now based in Brighton. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/capt-lovelace/railroad-club">Discover more on her SoundCloud.</a>
